Description:
I knew that I had to modify the return address of the function call but I really
didn't know how to achieve this. So I looked it up on Stack-Overflow and tried
different things until I found a solution that worked for my system.
Now it seems kind of obvious:
By creating a char I can access the first variable on the stack and from there
get to the right address to modify.

Change stack size:
Using the gcc compiler with the parameters '-wl,--stack,' and an appended stack
size works on Linux and (as far as i know) for Windows.
