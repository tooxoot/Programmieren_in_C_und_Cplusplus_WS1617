I hope i edited the program in the intended way.

The old function was wrapped in a class called "Workarround" thus becoming a
member of it which is not seen as the mainmethod run by the compiler.

An additional method called "main" outside of the class has to be defined which
is then run after compiling the program and executing the executable.
Inside of this method an object of the type of "Workarround" is initialized and
its member function "main" is called.
