                          returning an int.

int *(*x(int*))()         x is a function expecting an int pointer, returning a
                          pointer to a function returning an int pointer.

int *(*(*x())[])(int)     x is a function returning a pointer to an array of pointers
                          to functions expecting an int returning an int pointer.

int (*x)(int *(*)(int))   x is a pointer to a function expecting a pointer to a
                          function expecting an int returning an int pointer
                          returning an int
