Expectations:
  I expect the output to be 2.

Reality:
  The actual output is 1073741824. In 'scope2.c' globalvar is redefined as a float
  value which seems to be of a different endian than the int value. Therefore
  the output is such a huge number.

Prevention:

  Use the gcc option '-fno-common' to force the compiler to throw an error if
  multiple definition of a symbol appears.

  Use 'Wl,--trace-symbol=SYMBOL' to get notification of every definition and
  reference of specified symbol.

  Use 'Wl,--warn-common' to get a warning if multiple definitions of a symbol
  appear.
