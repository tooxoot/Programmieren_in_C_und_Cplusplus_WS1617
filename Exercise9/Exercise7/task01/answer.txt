TASK01-b

    The static member function call with 0.22 seconds for the n = 50000000 calls is the
    fastest.
    The second fastest are the calls to non-virtual member functions and virtual
    member functions on referenced objects with 0.33 seconds for n calls.
    Directly after those come calls of a non-virtual member function on pointers
    needing 0.37 seconds for n calls.
    The slowest group are calls of a virtual member function on pointers with 0.5
    seconds for the n calls.

    The static member call is the fastest because it takes no detour over a reference.
    Therefore the non-virtual member functions are slower.
    While calls on a pointer need to convert to a reference to call the function.

    First of all not all compilers support the RTTI needed for dynamic_casts.
    But the main problem with static calls is that the programmer himself has to
    make sure that the cast is actually valid and will result in a valid object.
    For Example if two classes B1 and B2 inherit from the same base class A you
    could access data from class B1 by casting from a A* pointer that points to
    a B2 object to an B2* pointer:
      A*  pA  = new B1();
      B2* pB2 = (static_cast<B2*> (pA));
    The Data provided in pB2 might be invalid resulting in undefined behavior.
