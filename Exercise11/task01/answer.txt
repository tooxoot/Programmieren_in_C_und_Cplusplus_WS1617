If i understood the task correctly the second element from the pair returned by
findposition(container, 31) is the iterator which has to be used for the insert
function. After the insertion printnext3 is called using the decremented second
element from the pair.
In my case the output from the printnext3 calls shows the following (order: vector, deque, list):

30 32 34
31 32 34
31 32 34

Considering that the insert method is adding the element in front of the given
iterator all of the printnext3 calls should start with 31 (like the list's output).
By taking the iterator validity from the different insert methods into account all
I can say is that only the list's output stays valid because here the iterators
are never invalidated. In the case of the vector and deque the iterator's validity
is not assured because the vector will be resized and reallocated, while the deque's
iterator are never staying valid.

To see how this issue is fixed and why the fix works please take a look at the
code and it's comments in line 92 and following.
